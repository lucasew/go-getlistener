## 2026-01-18 - Fix race condition in listener initialization **Vulnerability:** A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition existed in `listener_unix.go` where a port was selected using `GetAvailablePort` (which binds and immediately closes) before being re-bound by `net.Listen`. This could allow another process to steal the port in the interim. **Learning:** Avoid "checking" for availability by acquiring and releasing resources. Instead, acquire the resource directly (bind to port 0) and inspect the result. **Prevention:** Use `net.Listen("tcp", ":0")` to safely bind to a random available port atomically.
