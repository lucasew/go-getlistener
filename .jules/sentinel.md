## 2026-01-24 - Fix TOCTOU in Port Selection **Vulnerability:** The `GetListener` function in `listener_unix.go` uses `GetAvailablePort` to find a free port and then binds to it. This creates a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition where another process could grab the port between the check and the use. **Learning:** Avoid separating the check for availability and the resource acquisition. **Prevention:** Use `net.Listen("tcp", ":0")` to atomically bind to a random available port.
